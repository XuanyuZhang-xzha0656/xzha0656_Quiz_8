## Part1 Imaging Technique Inspiration
### Music Visualization


**Music visualization** is the process of turning sound into a waveform visible on the screen by capturing and analyzing the **spectral characteristics** of the sound. 
In the example below, the artist took inspiration from *traditional Chinese landscape paintings*, extracted *colors* and *landscape features* from the paintings, and transformed a piece of traditional Chinese music into the form of a landscape painting, so that the viewer can visually feel the emotional ups and downs of the music, resulting in a better audio-visual experience.
In a major project we can also use music visualization to make the painting change with the music.

[Note Envelope](https://p5js.org/zh-Hans/examples/sound-note-envelope.html)

Note envelope can be used to play back the amplitude of the audio by controlling the output and creating a fade-in/fade-out effect.

[Oscillator Frequency](https://p5js.org/zh-Hans/examples/sound-oscillator-frequency.html)
(*Notice: Example sound is a bit harsh, please lower the volume before opening this link!*)
Control an Oscillator and view the waveform using FFT.

[Filter LowPass](https://p5js.org/zh-Hans/examples/sound-filter-lowpass.html)
Apply a p5.LowPass filter to a p5.SoundFile. Visualize the sound with FFT. Map mouseX to the the filter's cutoff frequency and mouseY to resonance/width of the a BandPass filter.
